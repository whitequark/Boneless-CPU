- macros are not returning TokenLines directly
- need to go full circular, use whitequarks dissasembly output as canonical input
- rewrite token line parser to do command , params that are comma seperated
- need to handle comments
- need to add param counts to commands
- covert returns from macros and commands to all be TokenLines
