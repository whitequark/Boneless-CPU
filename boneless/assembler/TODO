- look at code ptr implementations
 - split out asm code blocks
 - look at data pointers so do>does can work
- stack return on inner forth intepreter is broken
- put fillet.py into the simulator
- integrate the assembler and the simulator for token access
- single stepping on the simulator
- later .... PTY for simulator , to prepare for gateware version
[done]- macros are not returning TokenLines directly
[done]- need to go full circular, use whitequarks dissasembly output as canonical input
[done]- rewrite token line parser to do command , params that are comma seperated
[done]- need to handle comments
[done]- need to add param counts to commands
[done]- covert returns from macros and commands to all be TokenLines
[done]- need get and set variable , and cross check the absolute resolver
